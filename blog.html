            <h2>what is the difference between localstorage and sessionstorage</h2>
            <p class="text-success fw-bold fs-4">
                1. sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't
                expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
                particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab
                <br>
                2. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire,
                whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends

            <h2>what is the difference between Global scope and block scope?</h2>
            <p class="text-success fw-bold fs-4">
                1. Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that
                function and cannot be used outside that function. Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if
                or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or
                loop <br>

                2. Function scoped variables: A function scoped variable means that the variable defined within a
                function
                will not accessible from outside the function. Block scoped variables: A block scoped variable means
                that the variable defined within a block will not be accessible from outside the block

            <h2>what is an event loop?</h2>
            <p class="text-success fw-bold fs-4">
                1. What is event loop in JavaScript interview questions?
                The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an
                asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event
                loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed <br>
                2. The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations
                on a single thread, but using a few smart data <br>

            <h2>8 type of undefine</h2>
            <p class="text-success fw-bold fs-4">
                1. variable that is not initialized will give undifined. <br>
                2. function with no return. <br>
                3. parameter that is not passed will be undifined.<br>
                4. if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined.<br>
                5. property that doesnot exists on an object will give you undifined.<br>
                6. accessing array elements outside of the index range.<br>
                7. deleting an element inside an array.<br>
                8.set a value directly to undefined.
